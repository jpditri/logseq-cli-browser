# Sequential Processing Output

Platform: claude
Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
Processing Time: 2.52s

I notice this appears to be a prompt template with variables for TASK_CONTENT and PRIORITY_LEVEL, but I don't see the actual task content or priority level filled in. To properly assist, I would need:

1. The specific task content that needs to be completed
2. The priority level assigned to this task

Could you please provide those details so I can help with completing the workflow test?
