This appears to be a metadata header for a directive prompt template. I can help write a CLI prompt based on this template. The key elements are:

The template has:
- An author: "Computer System"
- Category: "system" 
- Creation date: June 18, 2025
- Name: "Directive Prompt"
- Two variables: TASK_CONTENT and PRIORITY_LEVEL
- Version: 1.0

Would you like me to:

1. Generate a CLI prompt following this template structure?
2. Explain how to use this template?
3. Suggest improvements to the template?

Please let me know how I can help you work with this directive prompt template.
