Let me help you generate a response using this directive prompt template.

I notice this appears to be a YAML-formatted template header with the following fields:
- Author: Computer System 
- Category: system
- Created: 2025-06-18
- Description: Standard directive prompt template
- Name: Directive Prompt
- Variables: TASK_CONTENT, PRIORITY_LEVEL
- Version: 1.0

The task is listed as "test template fix v3"

Since this seems to be a test of the template format, I'll confirm I can parse the structure and variables. The template appears designed to handle tasks with content and priority level variables.

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a sample response using this template format?
2. Validate the template structure?
3. Something else specific with this template?

Please let me know how I can best assist with testing this template.
