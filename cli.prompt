Implement a cli interface tool to browse through a logseq pages/ directory that starts at a list of all pages and the ability to use vim-key style navigation and /pattern searching, when the cursor is on a link to another page, pressing 'o' should change the view to the linked page, 'b' should return to the previous page and the app should maintain an in memory list of the pages in the order they navigated to them. Pressing the 'e' key should open the file in the default editor for editing, upon writing and closing which the user should return to the logseq cli browser on the now updated page. ':q' should exit the cli. Ultrathink about this before creating the todo list, and break it into parts that multiple junior developers could work on together.
