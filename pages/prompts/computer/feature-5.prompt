# Computer CLI - Status & Management Commands

Add comprehensive status monitoring and directive management capabilities to the Computer CLI system.

## Feature Overview
Implement status reporting, cleaning, and data export functionality to provide visibility into the Computer system's operations and enable maintenance tasks.

## New Commands

### Status Command
`computer status` - Comprehensive system overview
- Count directives in each status directory (new, success, failed, slow, exemplars)
- API key configuration status
- Processing mode availability
- Recent activity summary
- Performance metrics overview

### Clean Command
`computer clean` - Maintenance and cleanup
- `computer clean` - Remove old files (30+ days)
- `computer clean --days 7` - Custom age threshold
- `computer clean --dry-run` - Preview what would be removed
- Clean success, failed, and slow directories

### Export Command
`computer export` - Data export and reporting
- `computer export` - Export all directive data to CSV
- `computer export -o report.csv` - Custom output file
- Include directive metadata, status, timestamps, and metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Status Reporting
- Scan all directive directories and count files
- Check API key availability (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Display processing capabilities based on configuration
- Show recent processing statistics

### File Management
- Safe file operations with error handling
- Age-based filtering using file modification times
- Dry-run mode for preview before deletion
- Atomic operations to prevent data loss

### Data Export
- CSV generation with comprehensive metadata
- Include directive ID, status, priority, created date, file path
- Sort by modification time (newest first)
- Support for custom output filenames with timestamps

## Enhanced CLI Features

### Improved Help System
- Detailed usage examples for all commands
- Command aliases (short forms): `d` for directive, `e` for engage, `s` for status
- Organized help sections by functionality
- Platform and model reference information

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing directories
- Informative error messages for common issues
- File permission and access error handling
- API connectivity validation

### Output Formatting
- Consistent emoji-based status indicators
- Tabular data presentation where appropriate
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Color-coded output (if terminal supports it)

## Configuration Management
- Settings file support (`.computer-settings`)
- Configurable thresholds and defaults
- User preferences for output format
- API timeout and retry settings

## Examples

### Status Output
```
📊 Computer System Status
==================================================
🆕 New         : 5 directives
✅ Success     : 23 directives  
❌ Failed      : 2 directives
🐌 Slow        : 8 directives
⭐ Exemplars   : 15 directives

🔑 API Configuration:
   Claude API   : ✅ Configured
   OpenAI API   : ❌ Missing

🚀 Processing Modes:
   Impulse (Batch) : ✅ Available
   Warp (Threads)  : ✅ Available
   Single          : ✅ Available
```

### Clean Operation
```
🧹 Cleaning directive directories...
🗑️  Removed 12 files from success/
🗑️  Removed 5 files from failed/
✅ Cleaned 17 old directive files
```

## Success Criteria
- Status command provides comprehensive system overview
- Clean command safely removes old files with confirmation
- Export command generates useful CSV reports
- All commands have consistent error handling
- Help system is complete and informative
- File operations are safe and atomic

This completes the Computer CLI with full monitoring and management capabilities.
