# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a logseq-cli-browser project - a system for building CLI tools and browser automation capabilities using Ruby.

## Project Architecture

The project will be rebuilt from scratch using Ruby as the primary language, with prompts available in the pages/prompts/ directory for reference.

## Directory Structure

```
├── bin/                   # Ruby executables and CLI tools
├── templates/             # Template files 
├── pages/prompts/         # Prompt files for reference
├── Gemfile               # Ruby gem dependencies
└── lib/                  # Ruby library code (future use)
```

## Development Workflow

### Ruby Development

```bash
# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Future Ruby CLI tools will be added to bin/
```

## Testing

Currently no formal testing framework. Manual testing via CLI commands.

## Technologies

- **Ruby**: Primary development language for CLI and automation
- **Markdown**: Documentation and template format
- **YAML**: Configuration format

## Project Context

This project is being rebuilt from scratch using Ruby for CLI and browser automation capabilities. The prompts directory contains reference material from the previous system that can be used as inspiration for new Ruby-based implementations.
