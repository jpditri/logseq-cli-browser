# Directive: test task

## Claude Code Integration
- **Claude Todo ID**: test1
- **Task ID**: 1750318608-e48ff53b
- **Session**: session-1750318608
- **Position**: 0 of 1
- **Priority**: Normal

## Task Overview
test task

## Context
This directive was generated from a Claude Code todo item. It maintains full integration with Claude Code's todo management system for status synchronization and progress tracking.

{{#TODO_INDEX}}
{{#if (gt TODO_INDEX 0)}}
### Prerequisites
This task depends on the completion of previous tasks in the sequence. Check that all prerequisite todos have been completed successfully before proceeding.
{{/if}}
{{/TODO_INDEX}}
