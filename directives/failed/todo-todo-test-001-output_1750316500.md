Response:
Sure, I can walk you through creating a simple "Hello World" CLI (Command Line Interface) application in Python.

Here's a simple way to create a CLI application:

First, we'll need a Python file. Let's call it `hello_world.py`.

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code:

- We define a function `main()` that prints "Hello, World!" when called.
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` line checks if this script is being run directly. If it is, it calls the `main()` function.

To run this as a CLI application, you'll need to use your terminal. Navigate to the folder where your `hello_world.py` file is located, then type `python hello_world.py` and press enter. It will print "Hello, World!" in the console.

This is a simple example, but Python allows you to create complex CLI applications with arguments, options, commands, etc. You may want to look into libraries like `argparse` or `click` if you're interested in creating more sophisticated CLI applications.
